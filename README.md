Analayze factors contributing to COVID19 spread rate across US counties.

In this project, I consider demographic factors that may affect the spread of COVID19 pandemics across US counties.

I would like to appreciate The New York Times that provides the US daily cases of COVID19 publicly [available](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) for non-commercial use.
