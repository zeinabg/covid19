Analayze factors contributing to COVID19 spread rate across US counties.

In this project, I consider demographic factors that may affect the spread of COVID19 epidemics across US counties.

Here are the data sources used in this project:
- COVID19 cases in US, prepared by New York Times, available [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
- US county [shape](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) files from US Census Bureau.
- US county [demographics](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html), from US Census Bureau.
